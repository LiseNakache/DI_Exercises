# Read about the PATH variable, and try to explain why you can call python3 even if you arenâ€™t in the executable directory.

# The path variable specifies a list that your executable directories are stored in. 
# If a program is specified in the path, it can be executed outside of the path it is physically stored in. 
# Hence, python can be called on any directory in order to compile and run python files there.
