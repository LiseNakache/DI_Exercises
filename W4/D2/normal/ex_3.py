# Recap â€“ What is a float? What is the difference between an integer and a float?
# Earlier, we tried to create a sequence of floats. Did it work?
# Can you think of another way of generating a sequence of floats?
# Create a list containing the sequence 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 without hard-coding the sequence.

# An integer is a natural number, a float is a decimal

# yes you can create a sequence of floats in a list for example

list_of_floats = [1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]

print(list_of_floats)

# Create a list containing the sequence 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 without hard-coding the sequence.
set_of_floats = {1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5}


print(set_of_floats)
