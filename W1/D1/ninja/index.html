            Bruce Banner
        </h3>

        <p>
            Dr. Bruce Banner lives a life caught between the soft-spoken scientist he's always been and the
            uncontrollable green monster powered in his rage.

    <div class="powers">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Powers</h1>
        <p>Exposed to heavy doses of gamma radiation, scientist Bruce Banner transforms into the mean, green rage
            machine called the Hulk.</p>
        <div>
                <h3>Superhuman Strength</h3>
                <p>The Hulk’s strength is immense, allowing him to stop foes even bigger than he is with a single blow,
                    to
                    throw massively heavy objects, and to tear apart metal as though it were paper.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
                <h3>Long Distance Jumping</h3>
                <p>The Hulk’s leg muscles are strong enough to allow him to leap great distances in a short period of
                    time.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
                <h3>Hulk Smash</h3>
                <p>Slamming his hands together, the Hulk can create a massive concussive wave.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
                <h3>Durability and Regeneration</h3>
                <p>The Hulk’s skin is able to withstand a tremendous amount of injury and he is able to heal far quicker
                    than a normal human when harmed.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
                <h3>Genius Intelligence</h3>
                <p>Bruce Banner is among Earth’s most brilliant men, leading to remarkable (if not always positive)
                    creations like Ultron alongside Tony Stark.
